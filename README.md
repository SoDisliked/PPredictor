# Stock-and-Market-Price-Prediciton-App-
My first DataScience project (as I discover the field) with a Python-engine build app with Stock prediction of some companies such as Facebook, Tesla or Apple. Uses Python 3.5.6 engine and JupyterNotebook for structure configuration and platform running. Uses HTML and JS to have access to the web app form.
