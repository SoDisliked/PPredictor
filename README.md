# Stock-and-Market-Price-Prediciton-App-
My first data science and data predicting project. PPredictor is intended to be a web and (potentially) a mobile application released on iOS devices. The purpose of this application are:
• The predicting of stock exchange market prices for each traded element (with the main ones in testing being the EUR/USD, Gold, Apple and Tesla).
• The inclusion of trading indicators helping passionates and traders to optimize their trading strategy (similar to tradingview.com's basis). 
• (In-development) The inclusion of historical, present and potential future forecasting of the data generated for all of these indicators by the creation of dashboards which are mainly supported by in-app generated dashboards.
• (In-development) The inclusion of a financial news rubric which notifies traders about the latest tendencies across the economy and stock exchange.

The project is intended to be released at the end of this year if I'll get my time ready and if I'll have enough support! Feel free to leave a feedback on the pulls and the breachers present in the document!

Credits are going to Chronoxor's "CppTrader" repository and nautechsystems' "Nautilus_Trader" repository. More credentials will be given further as I'll progress with the project.
